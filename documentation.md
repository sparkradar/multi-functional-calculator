## Overview

The Multi-Functional Calculator is a web application that allows users to perform a variety of conversions. The project is built using standard web technologies:
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** (with Bootstrap and custom styles) for design and responsiveness
- **JavaScript** for functionality and dynamic calculations

## Code Structure

- **index.html:**  
  Contains the HTML structure, embedded CSS, and JavaScript. It uses a tab-based layout where each tab corresponds to a different conversion (length, mass, area, etc.).

- **JavaScript Functionality:**  
  The JavaScript code listens for click events on the conversion buttons, validates user input, performs calculations based on the selected conversion option, and displays results in designated areas.

- **CSS Styling:**  
  Custom CSS is applied alongside Bootstrap to create a consistent theme. Variables are used for colors and fonts, making it easy to update the design globally.

## How to Use

1. **Select the conversion type:**  
   Click on one of the tabs (e.g., Length, Mass, Area, etc.).

2. **Enter the value:**  
   Provide the input number in the text field.

3. **Select the conversion option:**  
   Use the radio buttons to choose the conversion (e.g., Meters to Kilometers, Kilograms to Pounds).

4. **Click "Calculate":**  
   The result will be displayed in a designated area below the button.

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Input Validation:**  
  Additional checks and error messages for edge cases.

- **Modular Code Structure:**  
  Separate the JavaScript and CSS into external files for easier maintenance.

- **Unit Testing:**  
  Implement automated tests to verify the calculations and user interface.
